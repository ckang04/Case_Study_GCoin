## Overview and Background
The present study evaluates G-Coin as a key player in the FinTech space. Emergent Technology Holdings LP (EmTech), the parent company of G-Coin, was founded in 2017 by Brent De Jong. 
G-Coin is a digital currency that is backed by gold which gives investors the freedom to request that the physical gold be sent to them at any time. 
Traditionally, gold has been among the most illquid of investments, with high transaction costs and a spread between bid/ask. G-Coin gives investors the flexibility to send and receive value instantly, 
securely, and at no cost from the convenience of their mobile phone. G-Coin leverages blockchain technology to combine the best qualities of traditional gold - stability,
security, and value confidence - with the benefits of digital currency innovation. The company partnered with key gold industry leaders, including Yamana Gold, Valcambi sa,
and Asahi Refining, to create G-Coin tokens, structured so that each token is equivalent to one gram of gold.


## Advantages of G-Coin
G-Coin was designed to offer solutions to several issues that exists across the gold industry as well as the cryptocurrency market. Some of the main problems in the gold industry lies in the 
supply chain of gold and ethics surrounding it. With the innovation of blockchain technology, companies like EmTech are able to improve transparency and ethics of precious 
metal sourcing. While there are other gold-backed cryptocurrencies, G-Coin the only one that claims theirs is backed by conflict-free gold. Using EmeTech's blockchain
supply chain solution, called Responsibile Gold, G-Coin is able to trace the origins of responsible, conflict-free gold through the entire chain from mining, to refining, and through 
to vaults. Similar to all other cryptocurrency transactions, the blockchain technology enables everyone from the miners to the refiners to logistics providers and insurance companies
to track the movement of the asset across an immutable digital ledger. Another benefit of G-Coin on the gold industry is that it creates the opprotunity to get gold out to consumers and down to the retail level.

In addition to the positive impacts that G-Coin has on the gold industry, one of the key solutions that it provides in the financial industry is that it eliminates or reduces the high level of volitlity that is 
often associated with the cryptocurrency market. The issue with Bitcoin and most other digital currencies is that they are not backed by a real asset. Thus, their value is dictated solely by how much someone is willing to 
pay for them. Conversely, G-Coin, at the very least, will always equal the current price of gold which makes them considerably less volitile. As history has shown, gold may fluctuate but it is still classed
as a very expensive and in-demand precious metal. The other benefit of G-Coin in the financial industry is the expansion of the traditional buying base for gold. Analyst reports predict that B2B transactions 
alone are on track to exceed $210 trillion in the near future. 


Beyond the volitity of the cryptocurrency market, G-Coin also has the potential to have a greater effect on the global economy as it can protect companies against the vagaries of politics and economic downturns.
During time of extreme stress and inflationary pressures, the value of some currencies can plunge 30 to 50 percent. In 2018, the Argentinian peso and the Turkish lira were faced with these exact issues.
Mitch Davis, the Chief Commercial Officer at EmTech, stated,"We see an opprotunity for G-Coin tokens in emerging markets as an alternative to local currencies, and as a superior store of value with greater liquidity." G-Coin enables multinational companies to conduct cross-border transactions with greater speed and transparency. Davis explains, "With the G-Coin B2B wallet, corporations can move G-Coin tokens across borders in real time,
without transaction fees. Treasury deparments can hold G-Coin tokens, rather than volatile local fiat currencies, and cash out as needed on their own timelines, based on overall float management across liquidity pools."



## Limitations and Future Recommendations

Some of the risks and limitations identified during the study include:
1. Policy across different countries
2. Price Increases
3. Rise in Competition (e.g. TradeWind Markets Inc., etc.)

There are thousands of participants in the gold supply chain ranging from the miners, refiners, and transporation conduits and Davis shares, "You need to provide buyers - whether they are investors, individuals, instituations, or manufacturers - with an absolute guarantee that the gold is responsibly sourced." This is one of G-Coin's main competetive advantages and it will be imperative to uphold that integrity even as the demand and premiums for responsibly sourced gold rises. Furthermore, as popularity rises, the value of the coin will naturally increase as well. However, if the price of a G-Coin rises significantly higher than the value of a gram of gold per token, there is a risk that it may turn investors away. We recommend that EmTech and G-Coin closely monitors the demand for responsbily sourced gold in order to determine the appropriate premium that investors are willing to pay. Additionally, we recommend that G-Coin invests heavily in tapping into the B2B market in order to become the leading provider of cross-border payment solutions for multinational corporations.

## Conclusion
In many ways, G-Coin tokens serve as a digital certificate of title for physical gold. The success of G-Coin strongly relies on its ability to maintain their differentiating factor from the other highly volitile cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. Crypto Silbert of Smartereum classifies G-Coin as a different category from cryptocurrency. Silbert states, "Unlike cryptocurrencies, where ownership is purely based on possession, G-Coin will enable specific ownership, of both the coin and gold. As a result, it could be used for wealth transfers, payment of goods, or investment and trading purposes."
